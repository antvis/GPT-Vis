# GPT-Vis 1.0: Visualization for AI, Friendly!

## Vision

GPT-Vis is repositioning itself as **AntV's entry point for AI-powered visualization**. The new vision focuses on providing AI-friendly visualization components that work seamlessly across different technology stacks and frameworks.

### Core Philosophy

**AI-First Design**: We believe AI will gradually abstract away the complexities of underlying visualization engines. Users care about their needs, and AI-powered solutions are what matter most. GPT-Vis 1.0 embraces this by offering visualization syntax and components optimized for AI interaction, streaming output, and fault tolerance.

**Technology Agnostic**: Moving away from React-only implementation to support pure JavaScript, Vue, and other frameworks. This ensures GPT-Vis can serve as a universal visualization solution for AI applications across the entire frontend ecosystem.

**Unified Gateway**: GPT-Vis serves as the unified entry point for all AntV visualization libraries (G2, S2, G6, X6, L7) in AI environments, making it easier for AI agents to leverage powerful data visualization capabilities without understanding the intricacies of each engine.

The library now provides 20+ common statistical charts with enhanced capabilities, improved user experience, and reduced bundle size. It introduces an AI-friendly visualization syntax inspired by Infographic standards, supporting streaming rendering and robust error handling.

GPT-Vis 1.0 is designed for AI-driven scenarios including data visualization, data analysis, AI-generated reports, and presentations, ensuring that visualization remains accessible and powerful in the age of artificial intelligence.

## Release Schedule

**⏰ Version 1.0 Stable Release: Expected March 21, 2026**

Stay tuned for the official release featuring the complete reimagined architecture and comprehensive AI visualization capabilities.
